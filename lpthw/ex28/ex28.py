that you should testing if memorising boolean and got all that right and use terminal to known the anwsers


after terminal I got that

1.>>> True and True
True
2.>>> False and True
False
3.>>> 1 ==1 and 2==1
False
4.>>> "test" == "test"
True
5.>>> 1 == 1 or 2 !=1
True
6.>>> True and  1==1
True
7.>>> False and 0!=0
False
8.>>> True or 1==1
True
9.>>> "test" == "testing"
False
10.>>> 1 != 0 and 2 ==1
False
11.>>> "test" != "testing"
True
12.>>> "test" ==1
False
>>> not(True and False)
True
14.>>> not(1==1 and 0!=1)
False
15.>>> not(10 ==1 or 1000 ==1000)
False
16.>>> not(1 != 10 or 3 ==4 )
False
17.>>> not("testing" == "testing" and  "Zed" == "Cool Guy")
True
18.>>> 1==1 and (not("testing" == 1 or 1 ==0))
True
19.>>> "chunky" == "bacon" and(not(3 ==4 or 3==3))
False
20.>>> 3 == 3 and (not("testing" == "testing" or "Python" == "Fun"))
False


>>> yes I got all thing right I m perfect :)
