# right here like the previous but we do the operation with variale and number is same thing immediatly 
# and we 'll see when use the (fun) we got all we write after his and variable between the parenthese we change by we chosen math or string


#you see in {fun()}--> function  between the parenthesee() he got the math value easily inter or float math value like variable without use [inter()] but for text you should use quotes
