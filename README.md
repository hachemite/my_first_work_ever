# My First Work Ever  

This project is inspired by the book *Learn Python the Hard Way*. It includes nearly all the exercises from the book, along with my own examples to deepen my understanding. I've also added extensive comments to each line of code to make it a more thorough review.  

## Running the Exercises  

To run a specific exercise, use the following commands:  

```bash
cd ex<number>
python ex<number>.py
```

Replace `<number>` with the exercise number you want to run.
